# Markov chain Monte Carlo with PyMC3
### PyData London 2019 Tutorial


Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the most common approach for performing Bayesian data analysis. MCMC is a general class of algorithms that uses simulation to estimate a variety of statistical models. This tutorial will introduce users how to use MCMC for fitting statistical models using PyMC3, a Python package for probabilistic programming.

Bayesian methods are powerful tools for data science applications, complimenting traditional statistical and machine learning methods. Importantly, Bayesian models generate predictions and inferences that fully account for uncertainty. The main tool for conducting Bayesian analysis is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a computationally-intensive numerical approach that allows a wide variety of models to be estimated. MCMC algorithms are available in several Python libraries, including PyMC3. I will teach users a practical, effective workflow for applying Bayesian statistics using MCMC via PyMC3 using real-world examples.

This tutorial is intended for analysts, data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Anyone looking for effective ways of making predictions and obtaining inference from datasets should find it useful. The material will assume an intermediate level of Python familiarity. Ideally, attendees should be familiar with Numpy and Jupyter. There is no expectation of students having a statistical background. Having completed the tutorial, students should be able to build basic Bayesian statistical models using their own data, validate those models, and interpret their output.
